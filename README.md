# Introduction
1. The repository contains different research works for the two tasks : **Pedestrian Attribute Recognition** and **Anomaly Detection** <br>
2. Each task have further subdirectories of individual research works. <br>
3. The aim is to use the repositories to test the pretrained models on the corresponding datasets to match the results. <br>
4. Each repository of research work contains a `README` file to guide on how to run the models.
